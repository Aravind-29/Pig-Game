# Pig-Game
The Pig Game is a simple and entertaining dice game that involves rolling dice to accumulate points while avoiding certain outcomes that could result in losing all your points. The game is usually played with two players.

Here's a basic overview of how the Pig Game is typically played:

Objective:
The goal of the Pig Game is to be the first player to reach a predetermined score, usually 100 points.

Gameplay:

Players take turns rolling the two dice.

After each roll, the player accumulates points based on the numbers rolled.

✳️If a player rolls a 1 on either die, their turn ends, and they lose all points gained during that turn.
✳️If a player rolls a 1 on both dice (snake eyes), their turn ends, and they lose all accumulated points for the entire game.
✳️If a player rolls a 2 through 6 on both dice, they add the sum of the numbers to their turn total and can choose to roll again or end their turn, banking the points.
Players can continue rolling as many times as they like in a turn, but they risk losing all their points if they roll a 1.

A player can choose to "bank" their accumulated points at any time during their turn, adding them to their overall score for the game.

Play passes to the next player, and the process repeats.

The first player to reach or exceed the predetermined score (usually 100 points) wins the game.

The Pig Game is a balance of risk and reward, as players decide when to push their luck and when to play it safe by banking their points. It's a fun and quick game that doesn't require much setup.
